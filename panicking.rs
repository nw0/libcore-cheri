//! Panic support for libcore
//!
//! The core library cannot define panicking, but it does *declare* panicking. This
//! means that the functions inside of libcore are allowed to panic, but to be
//! useful an upstream crate must define panicking for libcore to use. The current
//! interface for panicking is:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::fmt;
//! fn panic_impl(fmt: fmt::Arguments, file_line_col: &(&'static str, u32, u32)) -> !
//! # { loop {} }
//! ```
//!
//! This definition allows for panicking with any general message, but it does not
//! allow for failing with a `Box<Any>` value. The reason for this is that libcore
//! is not allowed to allocate.
//!
//! This module contains a few other panicking functions, but these are just the
//! necessary lang items for the compiler. All panics are funneled through this
//! one function. Currently, the actual symbol is declared in the standard
//! library, but the location of this may change over time.
